**DISCLAIMER: The motor vehicle crash data referenced herein was provided by the Illinois Department of Transportation.** Any conclusions drawn from analysis of the aforementioned data are the sole responsibility of the data recipient(s).  Additionally, for coding years 2015 to present, the Bureau of Data Collection uses the exact latitude/longitude supplied by the investigating law enforcement agency to locate crashes. Therefore, location data may vary in previous years since data prior to 2015 was physically located by bureau personnel.

# Metadata CSV files

The csv files regarding basic metadata were developed based on the IDOT metadata, but are not created by IDOT.

## Differences between IDOT crash data and eCrash data

Reporting Requirements to IDOT: 

The legal reporting threshold for traffic crashes involving only property damage is $1,500 when all drivers are insured. However, if any driver does not have insurance, the threshold remains $500. In both cases, the investigating enforcement agency must complete and forward a written report to IDOT, on a form provided/approved by IDOT, within 10 days of the crash investigation. Private property crashes are not excluded from this requirement.
